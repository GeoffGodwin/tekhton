#### Milestone 6: Serena MCP Integration
<!-- milestone-meta
id: "6"
status: "done"
-->

Add optional LSP-powered symbol resolution via Serena as an MCP server. When
enabled, agents gain `find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`, and
`get_symbol_definition` tools that provide live, accurate cross-reference data.
This supplements the static repo map with runtime precision — the map tells
agents WHERE to look, Serena tells them EXACTLY what's there.

Files to create:
- `tools/setup_serena.sh` — setup script for Serena: clones or updates the
  Serena repo into `.claude/serena/`, installs its dependencies, generates
  project-specific configuration. Detects available language servers for the
  target project's languages (e.g., `pyright` for Python, `typescript-language-server`
  for TS/JS, `gopls` for Go). Idempotent. Invoked via
  `tekhton --setup-indexer --with-lsp`.
- `tools/serena_config_template.json` — template MCP server configuration for
  Claude CLI. Contains `{{SERENA_PATH}}`, `{{PROJECT_DIR}}`, `{{LANGUAGE_SERVERS}}`
  placeholders that `setup_serena.sh` fills in.
- `lib/mcp.sh` — MCP server lifecycle management: `start_mcp_server()`,
  `stop_mcp_server()`, `check_mcp_health()`. Starts Serena as a background
  process before agent invocation, health-checks it, stops it after the stage
  completes. Uses the session temp directory for Serena's socket/pipe.

Files to modify:
- `tekhton.sh` — source `lib/mcp.sh`. Add `--with-lsp` flag parsing for
  `--setup-indexer`. When `SERENA_ENABLED=true`, call `start_mcp_server()`
  before first agent stage and `stop_mcp_server()` in the EXIT trap.
- `lib/indexer.sh` — add `check_serena_available()` that verifies Serena
  installation and at least one language server. Update `check_indexer_available()`
  to report both repo map and Serena status separately.
- `lib/config.sh` — add defaults: `SERENA_ENABLED=false`,
  `SERENA_PATH=".claude/serena"`, `SERENA_LANGUAGE_SERVERS="auto"`,
  `SERENA_STARTUP_TIMEOUT=30`, `SERENA_MAX_RETRIES=2`.
- `lib/agent.sh` — when `SERENA_ENABLED=true` and Serena is running, add
  `--mcp-config` flag to `claude` CLI invocations pointing to the generated
  MCP config. This gives agents access to Serena's tools.
- `prompts/coder.prompt.md` — add `{{IF:SERENA_ENABLED}}` block: "You have
  access to LSP tools via MCP. Use `find_symbol` to locate definitions,
  `find_referencing_symbols` to find all callers of a function, and
  `get_symbol_definition` to read a symbol's full definition with type info.
  Prefer these over grep for precise symbol lookup. The repo map gives you
  the overview; LSP tools give you precision."
- `prompts/reviewer.prompt.md` — add Serena tool instructions for verifying
  that changes don't break callers
- `prompts/scout.prompt.md` — add Serena tool instructions for discovery:
  "Use `find_symbol` to verify that functions you find in the repo map
  actually exist and to check their signatures before recommending files."
- `templates/pipeline.conf.example` — add Serena config section

Acceptance criteria:
- `tekhton --setup-indexer --with-lsp` installs Serena and detects language servers
- MCP server starts before first agent stage and stops on pipeline exit
- `check_mcp_health()` returns 0 when Serena responds, 1 otherwise
- When Serena fails to start, pipeline logs warning and continues without LSP
  tools (agents still have the static repo map)
- Agent CLI invocations include `--mcp-config` when Serena is available
- Prompt templates conditionally inject Serena tool usage instructions
- `SERENA_ENABLED=false` (default) produces identical behavior to Milestone 5
- Serena process is always cleaned up on exit (no orphaned processes)
- All existing tests pass
- `bash -n lib/mcp.sh tools/setup_serena.sh` passes
- `shellcheck lib/mcp.sh tools/setup_serena.sh` passes

Watch For:
- Serena startup can take 10-30 seconds while language servers index the project.
  `SERENA_STARTUP_TIMEOUT` must be generous. Show a progress indicator.
- Language server availability varies wildly. A project may have `pyright` but
  not `gopls`. Serena should work with whatever's available and report which
  languages have full LSP support vs. tree-sitter-only.
- MCP server configuration format may change between Claude CLI versions. Keep
  the config template simple and version-annotated.
- Orphaned Serena processes are a real risk. The EXIT trap must kill the process
  group, not just the main process. Test with Ctrl+C, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL.
- The MCP `--mcp-config` flag may not be available in all Claude CLI versions.
  Detect CLI version and fall back gracefully.

Seeds Forward:
- Milestone 7 can use Serena's type information to enrich the tag cache with
  parameter types and return types (richer signatures)
- Future v3 milestones for parallel agents (DAG execution) will need per-agent
  MCP server instances or a shared server with locking — design the lifecycle
  management with this in mind
