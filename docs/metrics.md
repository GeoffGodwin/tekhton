# Metrics Dashboard

Track pipeline performance across runs with `--metrics`:

```bash
tekhton --metrics
```

```
Tekhton Metrics — last 20 runs
────────────────────────────────
Bug fixes:     12 runs, avg 22 coder turns, 92% success
Features:       6 runs, avg 45 coder turns, 83% success
Milestones:     2 runs, avg 85 coder turns, 100% success
────────────────────────────────
Scout accuracy: coder ±8 turns, reviewer ±2, tester ±5
Common blocker: "Missing test coverage" (4 occurrences)
Cleanup sweep:  15 items resolved, 3 deferred
```

Metrics are recorded automatically in `.claude/logs/metrics.jsonl`. When enough
history accumulates (`METRICS_MIN_RUNS=5`), adaptive calibration uses your project's
actual data to improve scout turn estimates.
